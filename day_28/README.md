## concepts covered

1. random module

- `random` displays random numbers between 0 to 1 but 1 not included. `uniform` can be used to generate random numbers between a range.
- we can also display random value from a list of choices using `random.choice(list)`

2. list comprehension
   `[expr for val in collection if test]`
