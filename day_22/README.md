## concepts covered

1. sets in python

- we can check methods available in `set` as well as help information for the methods as shown

```python
example = set()
dir(example) # this will show all methods available
help(example.add) # shows information on how to use the methods
```

- sets will only contain unique items
- sets has methods that involve how two sets can work together e.g `intersection`, `union`,
