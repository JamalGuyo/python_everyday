Going through [ Python series by socratis]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAzShkKzpJo&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-&index=3')

## concepts covered

1. strings in python
2. numbers in python
   - 4 types in python 2: int, long, float and complex
   - 3 types in python 3: int, float and complex
   - python automatically switches to long if int has an overflow
   ```python
    a = 123
    b = 2.718281828
    z =2 - 6.1j
    print(type(a), type(b), type(c)) # int, float, complex
   ```
