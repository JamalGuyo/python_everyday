#### Tuesday, 27-2-2024

Going through [Havard's cs50 introduction to programming in python]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4')

## concepts covered

1. String methods
   - used `strip`, `split`, and `title` methods
2. Interactive mode

   - you can start writing python code without saving if you type `python3` in your terminal
   - `>>` is a symbol to enter an expression
   - `...` indicates a line of code inside a block e.g inside a function or if statement
   - `_` used to as value of previously returned expression

3. coercion
   - convert a string into an integer using `int('100')`
   - convert a string to float using `float('100.23')`
4. builtin round function
   - by default rounds to nearest integer `round(11.23)` = `11`
   - you can define a digit to round to `round(11.23, 2)` = `11.23`
