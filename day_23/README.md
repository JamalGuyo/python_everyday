Going through [ Python series by socratis]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAzShkKzpJo&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-&index=3')

## concepts covered

1. list in Python

- we can create it using the `list()` function or easily with `[]`
- list preserves order of items.
- can contain any data type

2. list methods

- You can add two lists using the `+` operator (this is concatenation)

```Python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = a + b
```

- you can get a subset of a list by slicing

```Python
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = a[0:2]
```
