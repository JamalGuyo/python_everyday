Going through [ Python series by socratis]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAzShkKzpJo&list=PLi01XoE8jYohWFPpC17Z-wWhPOSuh8Er-&index=3')

## concepts covered

1. tuple

- It is works just like a string but it is immutable
- You can create an empty tuple with `t = ()`
- A tuple with a single item must have a single comma after `t = ('a',)`
- The paranthesis is optional `t='a',`
- we can unpack tuples to the respective variables `a, b, c = ("Jane", "John", "Paul")`
- You'll get a value error if you attempt to unpack more than the tuple contains `a,b,c,d=("Jane",)`
